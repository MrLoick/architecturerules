= Details =

Here are the steps that we'll go over

== Get the library ==

Download the latest from [http://code.google.com/p/architecturerules/downloads/list downloads]

== Write your architecture rules ==

Create architecture-rules.xml _anywhere_ in your classpath. If you are using maven, I'd suggest `src/test/resources`.

Write your configuration and rules by following this [SampleConfiguration sample configuration example].

Create your test class. See [WritingYourTest writing your test] example.

==Run the tests ==

Its a junit test. Run your unit tests however you do that. With your IDE, or with maven via `mvn test`
