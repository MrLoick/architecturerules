= Introduction =

This is a description of how to setup an environment to contribute to this project.


= Details =

First, you need to have the following installed... properly.
  * Maven 2.0.7 or 2.x
  * svn 

The follow the following steps:
  # create a folder, something like {{{c:\dev\svnlocal\architecturerules}}}
  # open command window or console and {{{cd c:\dev\svnlocal\architecturerules}}}
  # type {{{svn checkout http://architecturerules.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ architecturerules}}}

||*note* If you plan to make contributions, become a project member prior to checking out, because you'll need to use https:// with a username and password. If you checkout with http:// then decide to contribute, you'll have to delete your local checked out copy and start fresh with an https:// checkout.||

  
For *IntelliJ* users: 
 # type {{{mvn idea:idea -DownloadSources=true}}} _this could take a few minutes if you just installed maven_
 # close console
 # open {{{c:\dev\svnlocal\architecturerules\architecturerules.ipr}}} with IntelliJ
 # in IntelliJ goto {{{settings > version control}}} and ensure subversion is selected


For *Eclipse* users: 
 # For eclipse users: type {{{mvn eclipse:eclipse}}} _this could take a few minutes if you just installed maven_
 # close console
 # start eclipse
 # choose {{{import > existing project}}}
 # navigate to  
 # open {{{c:\dev\svnlocal\architecturerules\}}} and select the project file
